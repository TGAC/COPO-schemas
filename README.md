# COPO Metadata Schemas

The **COPO-schemas** repository contains a collection of **schemas for various types of metadata** used in the [COPO project website](https://copo-project.org), developed and maintained by the Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) team at the [Earlham Institute](https://www.earlham.ac.uk).

These schemas define metadata structures and checklists relevant to various omics data types and submission requirements. They serve as a reference for how metadata is structured across COPO's metadata workflows.

## What This Repository Contains 📂

- JSON, YAML and XLSX schemas organised by **metadata type** or **submission checklist**
- Versioned files to track schema evolution over time
- Human-readable definitions and descriptions within each schema
- Schema files used for **validation and rendering** in the COPO web application

> ⚠️ This repository is maintained separately from the COPO project source code, but its schemas are integrated into the COPO platform and used for metadata validation and manifest rendering.

## Schema Usage 🧩

These schemas are used internally by the COPO platform to:

- Drive user-facing metadata manifests
- Validate user-submitted metadata
- Inform data submission to external repositories (e.g. [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and [BioImage Archive (BIA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive))

They are not intended for direct use by external tools but may serve as references for integration or review.

## Checklist Types 📌

Each schema aligns with a **checklist** or **metadata category**, such as:

- Single-cell submissions
- Spatial ranscriptomic datasets
- Sample metadata
- Image metadata

## Terminology 📝

Checklists are sometimes referred to interchangeably as manifests. A manifest is essentially a spreadsheet (e.g., CSV or XLSX) that can be filled in with metadata relevant to a particular data type or submission workflow.

## Structure 🛠

The repository is structured as follows:
